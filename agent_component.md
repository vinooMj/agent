The world of AI agents is rapidly evolving, and so is the way they communicate! Its not a surprise how crowded and dynamic the agent protocol space has become.

Here’s a quick summary of the major protocols shaping the future of agent-to-agent collaboration:

 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗼𝗰𝗼𝗹 (𝗠𝗖𝗣)
• The current leader with over 5,000 servers.
• Created by Anthropic , Backed by industry giants like Microsoft, OpenAI, and Google DeepMind.
• Why it wins: Simple, lightweight JSON-RPC over HTTP; easy to integrate for developers.

 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁-𝘁𝗼-𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗼𝗰𝗼𝗹 (𝗔𝟮𝗔)
• Google’s answer to direct agent communication.
• Focuses on asynchronous, collaborative tasks between agents.
• Key feature: Supports long-running tasks and real-time updates via push notifications.

🕸 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝘂𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗼𝗰𝗼𝗹 (𝗔𝗖𝗣) & 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗡𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗼𝗰𝗼𝗹 (𝗔𝗡𝗣)
• ACP: Competing versions from IBM and Cisco, focusing on structured messaging and registries.
• ANP: Takes a decentralized approach, leveraging W3C DIDs for trustless agent interaction.

𝗔𝗴𝗼𝗿𝗮 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗼𝗰𝗼𝗹
• A novel approach: Starts with natural language, letting agents negotiate and upgrade their communication methods on the fly.

 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗕𝗶𝗴 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗲𝘀
Despite the innovation, all protocols face hurdles:
• Discovery: How do agents find each other?
• Authorization & Payment: Who gets access, and who pays?
• Trust & Reputation: How do we keep the network safe from bad actors?
